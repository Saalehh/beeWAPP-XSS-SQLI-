## Solution :

>First i found that there is a page that require me to choose a movie category from three categories ,
so i choosed one of them and submitted and i said to me "Thank you for making your choice!" 
so there is no thing reflected so according to the task name it is related to stored cookie XSS ,
so i tried to open my BurpSuite and intercepted the request after choosing the film category 
and i found that in the cookie field mt choice is sent in it , so i tried to add a new category that is not found in the choices ,
and i achieved that by sending this new category in the url parameters and when the BurpSuite intercepted it ,
i found that request had already sent with the new parameters , and after forwarding this request and reloaded the page ,
i found in BurpSuite that the cookie in the request is sent with the value that i have inserted at the last time ,
so that means that i can inject a malicious code in the cookies and it will be stored in the browser, 
and the next time the user requested the page that is related to that cookie the malicious code will be executed !
