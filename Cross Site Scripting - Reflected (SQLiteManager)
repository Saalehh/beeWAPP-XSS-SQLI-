## Solution :

> First i found " The SQLiteManager version is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting! (bee-box only)
  HINT: CVE-2012-5105 " .

  after searching for that i found that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the query string parameter.
  When a victim user visited the affected web page with the vulnerable parameter,
  the malicious code would execute in the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information.

  So , i clicked on the link "SQLiteManager" to see what will it redirect me and i found a page for SQLiteManager databse version 1.2.4 ,
  and in this page i can create a new database connection by giving the name of the connection and its path in the input fields ,
  and when i opened the inspect element for this page i found that there is a form and the action of this form is 
  redirecting me to another page called "main.php" so i got into this page and i found a page that is too similar to the last one ,
  so i tried to give any data to the input field and it redirected me to another page but there is any something or action happened ,
  so i got back to the page and tried to inject a payload in the input fields : script>alert("XSS");</script> , with opening BurpSuite to see the request ,
  i found that my payload travels with the script and when i forwarded it , my payload worked , 
  also when i pass this payload in the BurbSuite as the value of dbsel parameter it works so there is a stored XSS.
