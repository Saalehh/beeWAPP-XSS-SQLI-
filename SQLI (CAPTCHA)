## Solution :

> First the page found wants me to enter the CAPTHCA in an input field ,
  so lets try to enter the correct CAPTHCA and see what would happen , 
  when i did that i was redirected to another page that has an input filed and a table so when i entered a film name in this input field
  it shows me some details about this film in the table and that is obvious that to do that it should communicate to the database with my input ,
  so lets inject a payload in this input and see what can we find , i can see my input in the query parameters , so lets try this `iron man' AND sleep(5) --` ,
  an error message displayed instead of the film details and this message said that my syntax in sql is not correct , it also showed that it uses MySQL , 
  so lets try : `IRON+MAN'UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7--+` in the query parameters , it worked and that means that we could execute a sql query through input field ,
  in addition another thing i noticed that if i submitted without typing any thing in the input field this will retrieve me all the records in the database !
